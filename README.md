# üß™ scrap_projects

A collection of experimental AI/NLP modules and half-formed ideas ‚Äî part playground, part prototype. These aren't polished projects (yet), but they‚Äôre real pieces of something I‚Äôm building.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### üß† `emodetector/` *(WIP NLP Emotion Pipeline)*
A lightweight, modular text processor built to detect emotional tone in raw input. It‚Äôs stitched together from a bunch of preprocessing tools and custom logic.

#### Key Modules:
- `main.py` ‚Äì Runs the full pipeline and returns labeled outputs like `[EMO_HAPPY]`, etc.
- `contraction.py` ‚Äì Expands contractions like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúdo not‚Äù
- `negation.py` ‚Äì Tracks negation patterns for sentiment shifts
- `slang.py` ‚Äì Normalizes slang terms
- `emoji.py` ‚Äì Detects and interprets emoji as emotional signals
- `entity_emphasis.py` ‚Äì Boosts emotional weight on key named entities
- `pos_guesser.py` ‚Äì Simple POS pattern matcher (used in logic tweaks)
- `tokenizer.py` ‚Äì Basic token splitting and cleaning
- `mainPipeline.py` ‚Äì Possibly the combined runner for all components

> It's messy, modular, and kinda fun to break.

### üß¨ `injection/`
A sketchpad for mood-driven prompt engineering. Currently contains:
- `mood_primers`: dictionary of moods with prompt examples
- `scenario` and prompt templates
- No direct integration with transformers yet ‚Äî still conceptual

---

## ‚úÖ Status
- Some parts like `emodetector/main.py` are working and return output.
- Others (like `injection/`) are just structure, not functional yet.

This repo is mostly a work-in-progress ‚Äî feel free to poke around if you're curious.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Why share scraps?
Because the path to polished ideas is full of weird, broken, exciting half-projects. This repo is a slice of that process.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not production ready. No unit tests. No regrets.
